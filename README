NeoTextureEdit2
===============

This project is a fork of the NeoTextureEdit project, which has seemingly been abandonen/forgotten by its creators.
NeoTextureEdit2 is an attempt to improve NeoTextureEdit. Currently, the only improvement that has been
implementeed thus far is:

- Instead of using JFileChooser for choosing files, FileDialog is now used instead. Because quite frankly,
JFileChooser is fucking terrible to use. 



How to use the program
===============

In the OpenGL preview pane(the bottommost panel), you can zoom in and out by holding in the shift key and the left mouse button and then moving around the mouse.

In the Texture Graph panel(the centremost panel), you can move around by holding the middle mouse button and 
moving the mouse. If you are using a laptop and don't have a middle mouse button, you can instead hold down
the control key and the left mouse button, and then move around the mouse.
